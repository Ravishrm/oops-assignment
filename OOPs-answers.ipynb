        "1] What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a coding style that organizes software around objects (data + actions) instead of just functions.It has 4 Key Pillars: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2] What is a class in OOP\n",
        "- A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines:\n",
        "\n",
        "      Data (attributes) → Variables (e.g., name, age).\n",
        "\n",
        "      Behavior (methods) → Functions (e.g., eat(), run()\n",
        "\n",
        "3] What is an object in OOP\n",
        "- An object is a real-world entity created from a class (blueprint). It has (data) which are stored in attributes (variables) or Behavior (actions) which are defined by methods (functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "4] What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction means to hide complex details,and show only essential features.They are done to simplify usage (user doesn't need to know internal workings).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation means to Bundle data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class), restricting direct access. It is done to protect data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "5] What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        "- Dunder (double underscore __) methods are special predefined methods in Python that enable operator overloading, object behavior customization, and more.They make objects behave like built-in types (e.g., lists, strings).They enable operator overloading (+, -, ==, etc.)and they customize object behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "6] Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "- Inheritance allows a class (child) to reuse and extend the attributes/methods of another class (parent). They are helpful in avoiding rewriting common logic. It is used to organize code hierarchically and to add new features without modifying the parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "7] What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "- Polymorphism lets objects of different classes be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables:\n",
        "\n",
        "  a) One interface, multiple implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "  b) Same method name, different behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "8] How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python is achieved by:\n",
        "\n",
        "  a)Using classes to bundle data (attributes) and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "  b)Restricting access to variables by prefixing:\n",
        "\n",
        "    -> _var for protected.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -> __var for private.\n",
        "\n",
        "This hides internal object details and allows control via methods (getters/setters).\n",
        "\n",
        "9] What is a constructor in Python\n",
        "- A constructor is a special method that automatically runs when an object is created. It initializes the object's state (sets default values for attributes).\n",
        "\n",
        "10] What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        "- Class Method are defined with\n",
        "\n",
        "    - @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Takes cls as the first parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Can access/modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Used for factory methods or when behavior depends on the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Static Method:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Defined with @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Takes no self or cls parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Acts like a regular function, but belongs to the class namespace.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Used when logic is related to the class but doesn’t access class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11] What is method overloading in Python\n",
        "- Method overloading lets a class have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. In python they are\n",
        " achieved by Default Arguments, Variable-Length Arguments (*args, **kwargs), Single Dispatch (functools.singledispatch).\n",
        "\n",
        "12] What is method overriding in OOP\n",
        "- Method overriding allows a child class to provide a new implementation for a method already defined in its parent class. They only works with parent-child class relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "13] What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        "- The @property decorator in Python is used to define a method as a getter, allowing access to it like an attribute.It helps implement encapsulation by controlling access to private attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14] Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        "- Polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows:\n",
        "\n",
        "      Code flexibility - Different classes can be treated as the same interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Reusability - Same method name can work with different types.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Extensibility - New classes can be added with minimal code change.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Simplified code - Enables writing general, cleaner, and maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "15] What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and is used to define a common interface for its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        " It is created using the abc module:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Use from abc import ABC, abstractmethod.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Inherit from ABC.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Use @abstractmethod to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16]  What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):\n",
        "\n",
        " - Modularity – Code is organized into classes and objects, making it easier to manage.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Reusability – Inheritance allows code reuse across multiple classes.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Encapsulation – Hides internal details and protects object integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Polymorphism – Enables flexibility by allowing the same interface for different data types.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Maintainability – Easier to update and modify without affecting other parts of the code.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Scalability – Ideal for large and complex software systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "17] What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        "- Class variable:\n",
        "  - Shared across all instances of a class.\n",
        "  - Inside the class, outside methods.\n",
        "  - Access- ClassName.var or self.__class__.var\n",
        "  - Memory allocation is single copy for the class.\n",
        "  - They are used for constants, default values.\n",
        "- Instance variable:\n",
        "  - Unique to each instance (object).\n",
        "  - Inside __init__ or other methods.\n",
        "  - Access- self.var (per instance).\n",
        "  - Memory allocation is separate copy for each instance.\n",
        "  - They are use for Object-specific properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "18] What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance is a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This allows a child class to combine functionalities from multiple sources.\n",

        "    Purpose: Provide a user-friendly, informal string representation of an object.\n",

        "b.  __repr__ (Unambiguous Representation)\n",

        "   Purpose: Provide an official, unambiguous string representation (ideally, valid Python code to recreate the object).\n",
        "\n",
        "   Used by: repr(), the Python interpreter (when you just type the object in a REPL).\n",
        "\n",
        "   Focus: Debugging and developer clarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "20] What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        "- The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (super) class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Significance of super():\n",
        "      -Access parent class methods without hardcoding the class name.\n",

        "- The __del__ method (also called a destructor) is a special method in Python that gets called when an object is about to be destroyed. However, its behavior and use cases require careful understanding due to Python's garbage collection mechanism.\n",

        "\n",
        "    a) A base class defines a method.\n",
        "\n",
        "    b) Subclasses override that method with their own implementation.\n",
